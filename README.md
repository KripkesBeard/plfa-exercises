# Programming Language Foundations In Agda

This is a repo containing solutions to the exercises in Wadler, Kokke, and Siek's book
[Programming language Foundations in Agda](https://plfa.github.io/).

Because of how the book is set up, it's difficult to separate the exercises from the pages, so this repo is
just a collection of the pages of the book with my solutions to the exercises pasted in after being typechecked.
Everything still belongs to the authors, of course.
